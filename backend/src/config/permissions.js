// --- Permissions -----------------------------------------------------------

const PERMISSIONS = {
  READ_EMPLOYEE: 'READ_EMPLOYEE',
  WRITE_EMPLOYEE: 'WRITE_EMPLOYEE',
  DELETE_EMPLOYEE: 'DELETE_EMPLOYEE',
  READ_PAYROLL: 'READ_PAYROLL',
  WRITE_PAYROLL: 'WRITE_PAYROLL',
  // Maker–checker: the account that submits a payroll run should not be the
  // only thing standing between a figure and a bank transfer. Kept separate
  // from WRITE_PAYROLL so the two can be held by different people (#458).
  APPROVE_PAYROLL: 'APPROVE_PAYROLL',
  READ_REPORT: 'READ_REPORT',
  // Kept apart from READ_REPORT because they are not the same act. Viewing a
  // report is a read; standing up a recurring job that mails a payroll register
  // to an address of your choosing is a write, and a fairly serious one. Both
  // scheduler write routes were gated on READ_REPORT, which every role holds
  // including Employee — so anyone who could view a report could also schedule
  // an export of company salary data to an external mailbox, or delete another
  // admin's schedule (#666).
  MANAGE_REPORT_SCHEDULE: 'MANAGE_REPORT_SCHEDULE',
  // A webhook endpoint is a standing instruction to POST company payroll and
  // employee data to an external URL, signed with a secret this account owns.
  // Creating, editing, rotating the secret for or deleting one is a write that
  // can point data anywhere, so it is its own permission and it stays with the
  // owner role — deliberately not something every admin of the workspace can do
  // (#474).
  MANAGE_WEBHOOKS: 'MANAGE_WEBHOOKS',
  // Connecting an HRMS (#954) points an external system at the whole employee
  // directory and lets it write into it, under credentials this account
  // installs. Same class of authority as MANAGE_WEBHOOKS above, and kept with
  // the owner for the same reason.
  MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS: 'MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS',
  // Expense claims (#719). routes/expense.routes.js has asked for these since
  // it was written and none of them existed here, so the seeder never created
  // them, no role held them, and every expense endpoint answered 403 for every
  // account in the product — the owner included, because SUPER_ADMIN below is a
  // fixed list and not a wildcard (#794).
  READ_EXPENSE: 'READ_EXPENSE',
  WRITE_EXPENSE: 'WRITE_EXPENSE',
  // Kept apart from WRITE_EXPENSE for the same reason APPROVE_PAYROLL is kept
  // apart from WRITE_PAYROLL: whoever submits a claim for payment should not be
  // the only person standing between it and a bank transfer.
  APPROVE_EXPENSE: 'APPROVE_EXPENSE',
  // A category carries the `isTaxable` flag, which decides whether a claim is
  // paid as taxable earnings or as a tax-free reimbursement. That is a tax
  // decision rather than day-to-day expense admin, so it stays with the owner.
  MANAGE_EXPENSE_CATEGORY: 'MANAGE_EXPENSE_CATEGORY',
  // Statutory compliance (#933, reachable since #951). Deliberately not
  // READ_REPORT: a Form 16 is one person's complete tax position and a Form 24Q
  // export is every employee's PAN, salary and tax in one file, while
  // READ_REPORT is held by every role including Employee.
  // Declared here because `routes/role.routes.js` gates all four of its routes
  // on it and `PERMISSION_DEFINITIONS` below already has an entry for it — but
  // the name itself was never added to this object, so every one of those
  // routes called `requirePermission(undefined)` and the definition was written
  // to the database with `name: undefined`. Found while adding the compliance
  // permissions below, because the invariant tests in `permissions.expense.test`
  // and `rbac.seed.test` fail on it.
  MANAGE_ROLES: 'MANAGE_ROLES',
  READ_COMPLIANCE: 'READ_COMPLIANCE',
  // Writing the company's TAN, or marking a tax declaration verified, decides
  // what gets filed with the tax department under the employer's name. Kept
  // with the owner for the same reason MANAGE_EXPENSE_CATEGORY is.
  MANAGE_COMPLIANCE: 'MANAGE_COMPLIANCE',

  // --- Feature areas that had no vocabulary of their own (#1011) -----------
  //
  // Eight areas shipped between #955 and #993 and every one reused
  // WRITE_EMPLOYEE and READ_EMPLOYEE as a catch-all, so those two guarded 36
  // of the 52 gated routes in the product. WRITE_EMPLOYEE is what you give an
  // HR coordinator so they can add a joiner; it also authorised running
  // depreciation across the fixed-asset register, setting the TDS withheld on
  // a vendor invoice, issuing employment contracts and writing anybody's
  // performance rating.
  //
  // That matters more than tidiness because #475's custom-role feature is
  // live. An owner composing a least-privilege role at /api/roles is shown
  // WRITE_EMPLOYEE described as employee-record editing, and the description
  // was false.

  READ_ASSET: 'READ_ASSET',
  MANAGE_ASSET: 'MANAGE_ASSET',
  // Separate from MANAGE_ASSET, and deliberately not held by HR. Depreciation
  // writes book values across the whole register in one call — an accounting
  // period action, closer to MANAGE_COMPLIANCE than to assigning a laptop.
  RUN_DEPRECIATION: 'RUN_DEPRECIATION',

  READ_VENDOR: 'READ_VENDOR',
  // Recording a vendor invoice sets the 194C/194J TDS withheld, and therefore
  // what the company remits on that contractor's behalf. Same class of
  // authority as MANAGE_COMPLIANCE.
  MANAGE_VENDOR: 'MANAGE_VENDOR',

  READ_ROSTER: 'READ_ROSTER',
  MANAGE_ROSTER: 'MANAGE_ROSTER',

  READ_CONTRACT: 'READ_CONTRACT',
  // Issuing an offer letter commits the company to a salary. Kept apart from
  // WRITE_EMPLOYEE for the same reason APPROVE_PAYROLL is kept apart from
  // WRITE_PAYROLL.
  MANAGE_CONTRACT: 'MANAGE_CONTRACT',

  READ_APPRAISAL: 'READ_APPRAISAL',
  MANAGE_APPRAISAL: 'MANAGE_APPRAISAL',
  // Self-service. An employee reading their own review is not the same act as
  // an HR manager reading everyone's, and gating the first on READ_EMPLOYEE —
  // which the Employee role does hold — happened to work while describing the
  // wrong thing.
  READ_OWN_APPRAISAL: 'READ_OWN_APPRAISAL',

  READ_INVOICE: 'READ_INVOICE',
  MANAGE_INVOICE: 'MANAGE_INVOICE',

  // Self-service, and the reverse mistake: `POST /api/tax-proofs` is an
  // employee uploading their own investment proof, and it was gated on
  // WRITE_EMPLOYEE — which a rank-and-file employee does not hold and should
  // not. TaxProofPortal.jsx therefore 403s for every user it was built for.
  SUBMIT_TAX_PROOF: 'SUBMIT_TAX_PROOF',
  // The HR side of the same feature: approving a proof changes the TDS
  // deducted from somebody's salary.
  VERIFY_TAX_PROOF: 'VERIFY_TAX_PROOF',

  READ_PYQ: 'READ_PYQ',
  // `pyq.routes.js` applied `auth` and nothing else, so any authenticated
  // account in any tenant could bulk-upload questions and trigger forecast
  // generation.
  MANAGE_PYQ: 'MANAGE_PYQ',

  // --- Training and certification (#1076) ----------------------------------
  READ_TRAINING: 'READ_TRAINING',
  // Creating courses, assigning them, recording completions and waiving
  // obligations. Stays with HR rather than moving to the owner: assigning
  // fire-safety training commits no budget and moves no money. The one action
  // with real weight is the waiver, and that is bounded by the endpoint
  // requiring a written reason.
  MANAGE_TRAINING: 'MANAGE_TRAINING',
  // Self-service. `getMyTraining` resolves the employee from `req.userId`.
  COMPLETE_OWN_TRAINING: 'COMPLETE_OWN_TRAINING',

  // --- Business travel (#1077) ---------------------------------------------
  READ_TRAVEL: 'READ_TRAVEL',
  // Filing a trip you are about to take. Held by employees — that is the point
  // of the feature.
  SUBMIT_TRAVEL_REQUEST: 'SUBMIT_TRAVEL_REQUEST',
  // Approving a trip, releasing an advance and settling it. Kept apart from
  // submission for the same reason APPROVE_EXPENSE is kept apart from
  // WRITE_EXPENSE: whoever asks for the money should not be the only person
  // standing between it and a bank transfer.
  APPROVE_TRAVEL: 'APPROVE_TRAVEL',
  // The grade x city-class rate table decides what everybody in the company is
  // entitled to, so editing it is not a per-trip decision. Same class of
  // authority as MANAGE_EXPENSE_CATEGORY.
  MANAGE_TRAVEL_POLICY: 'MANAGE_TRAVEL_POLICY',

  // --- Equity (#1073) ------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // Three names rather than the usual read/write pair, because the acts differ
  // in kind and not just in direction.
  READ_ESOP: 'READ_ESOP',
  // Issuing a grant dilutes the cap table, and recording an exercise creates a
  // perquisite filed under the employer's TAN. Neither is HR admin. This is
  // MANAGE_CONTRACT's reasoning — an offer letter commits the company to a
  // salary — one notch further along, so it stops at the owner.
  MANAGE_ESOP: 'MANAGE_ESOP',
  // Self-service. `getMyGrants` resolves the employee from `req.userId`, so
  // holding this does not let one employee read a colleague's holding.
  READ_OWN_ESOP: 'READ_OWN_ESOP',

  // --- Recruitment (#1074) -------------------------------------------------
  READ_REQUISITION: 'READ_REQUISITION',
  // Opening a role commits headcount budget, and the approved CTC band is what
  // every offer is checked against — so being able to widen a band is being
  // able to approve any offer. Owner only, for the same reason MANAGE_CONTRACT
  // is.
  MANAGE_REQUISITION: 'MANAGE_REQUISITION',
  // Running the pipeline: adding applicants and moving them between stages.
  // HR's day job, and deliberately not the same authority as setting the band
  // those candidates are offered against.
  MANAGE_CANDIDATE: 'MANAGE_CANDIDATE',
  // Interviewers are not recruiters. This is held by whoever sits on a panel,
  // which is a different and much larger population than HR.
  SUBMIT_INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK: 'SUBMIT_INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK',

  // --- Salary disbursement (#1075) -----------------------------------------
  READ_DISBURSEMENT: 'READ_DISBURSEMENT',
  // Building a batch, validating it and downloading the bank file. The download
  // is the only response in the product that carries full bank account numbers,
  // which is why it is not covered by the read permission.
  MANAGE_DISBURSEMENT: 'MANAGE_DISBURSEMENT',
  // The point of no return, and kept apart for the same maker-checker reason as
  // APPROVE_PAYROLL (#458): whoever assembles a payment file should not be the
  // only person standing between it and a bank transfer. This is the highest
  // consequence write in the product — everything else changes a record, this
  // one moves money out of the company account into several hundred others.
