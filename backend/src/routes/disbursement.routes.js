/**
 * Salary disbursement routes — mounted at /api/disbursements (#1075).
 *
 * Three permissions, and the split is the same maker–checker reasoning that
 * keeps APPROVE_PAYROLL apart from WRITE_PAYROLL (#458):
 *
 *   - READ_DISBURSEMENT     see batches, lines and return status
 *   - MANAGE_DISBURSEMENT   build a batch, validate it, download the file
 *   - RELEASE_DISBURSEMENT  mark it released — the point of no return
 *
 * Whoever assembles a payment file should not be the only person standing
 * between it and a bank transfer. This is the highest-consequence write in the
 * product: everything else changes a record, this one moves money out of the
 * company's account into several hundred others.
 *
 * `GET /batches/:id/file` sits under MANAGE_DISBURSEMENT rather than
 * READ_DISBURSEMENT on purpose. It is the only response in the product that
 * carries full bank account numbers, so it is not a read in the sense the read
 * permission means.
