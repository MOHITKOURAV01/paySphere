/**
 * The Express application.
 *
 * This file was unparseable on `main` between #539 and #792. Two separate
 * events put it there, and the second is the reason it is worth a comment:
 *
 *   - #539 added the Apollo requires twice — once at the top of the file and
 *     once in the middle of the middleware stack — and then called
 *     `await apolloServer.start()` at module scope. `backend` is CommonJS, so
 *     top-level `await` is a syntax error whatever else is going on.
 *
 *   - #785's "Merge branch 'main' into feature/soft-delete-759" resolved a
 *     whitespace-only conflict by keeping *both* sides, so the file ended up
 *     with two complete copies of the require block, the middleware stack and
 *     the route table.
 *
 * The two copies of the route table were not identical, which is the part that
 * bites quietly: the first mounted `/api/archive` and not `/api/notifications`,
 * the second the other way round, and Express serves whichever match it reaches
 * first. Neither mounted `/api/expenses`. The mount list below is the union, and
 * `__tests__/app.routeMounting.test.js` now asserts it so a future merge cannot
 * drop a router without a test going red.

// ─── Middleware ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Order matters, and it is the reason #663 existed: a router mounted above this
// block gets none of it. Everything below `app.use('/api', …)` is therefore
// declared after the whole stack, with no exceptions.

// Security headers (#896).
//
// `helmet` has been in this file's require block, and in package.json, since
// before #792 — and was never called. Not once. So the API shipped with no
// CSP, no `nosniff`, no `Referrer-Policy`, no frame protection and no HSTS,
// while the comment above the dashboard mount below describes "no security
// headers" as the bug #663 fixed. The mount was moved under the middleware
// stack; the headers were never put into the stack.
//
// Two directives are set explicitly rather than left at their defaults, because
// the defaults are wrong for this particular server:
//
//   - The CSP default is tuned for a server that returns HTML. This one returns
//     JSON to a separate frontend origin, so nothing it serves should ever load
//     a script, a style or a frame. `default-src 'none'` says exactly that, and
//     `frame-ancestors 'none'` is what actually stops an authenticated response
//     being framed — `X-Frame-Options` is the legacy half of the same idea and
//     Helmet still sends it.
//
//   - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` defaults to `same-origin` in Helmet 8,
//     which would block the frontend on :5173 from reading responses from the
//     API on :5000 *even though* the CORS config below allows the origin. The
//     two mechanisms are separate checks and both have to pass. `cross-origin`
//     here leaves the origin decision to `corsOptions`, which is the one place
//     it should be made.

// the next router to arrive without a mount fails CI rather than going quiet
// for a few months.
